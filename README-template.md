## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process
I visualized the main component of the card into rectangles and further subdivided those component into rectangles this aided in styling each component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I intend to focus on position property in css particulary absolute and relative positioning.
