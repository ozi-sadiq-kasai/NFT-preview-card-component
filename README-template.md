This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My process
I visualized the main component of the card into rectangles and further subdivided those component into rectangles this aided in styling each component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I intend to focus on position property in css particulary absolute and relative positioning.
